This article is part of my review notes of “Theory of Computation” course.  In this post we focus on the classic topic: class of **P, NP, NP-Complete**.

## Turing Machine Models

In the previous post, we introduced the difference variants of Turing machines: 1-tape TM, k-tape TM, nondeterministic TM (NTM), enumerator, etc. Among these models, NTM is special because of nondeterminism. We want to examine the class of P and NP without considering the specific models.

Claim: all reasonable deterministic computational models are polynomially equivalent, while simulation of nondeterministic TM has exponential slowdown.

Simulate k-tape TM in $O(f(n))$: 1-tape TM in $O(f^2(n))$

Simulate RAM in $O(f(n))$: 1-tape TM in $O(f^6(n))$ or better

Simulate NTM in $O(f(n))$: 1-tape TM in $2^{O(f(n))}$ (the exponential slowdown is similar to the simulation of NFA using DFA, see previous post)

## The Class of P

Let's look at the definition directly.

The time complexity class **TIME(t(n))**: the collection of all languages that are decidable by an $O(t(n))$ deterministic Turing machine.

The class of P: languages that are decidable in polynomial time on a deterministic Turing machine.

$$P = \bigcup_k \text{TIME}(n^k)$$

Any reasonable deterministic TM model would apply, since they are all polynomial equivalent.

Examples of languages in P:
* Regular language (linear)
* Context-free language ($O(n^3)$ on RAM by "CYK" algorithm)
* Many problems that have polynomial algorithms

## The Class of NP

The time complexity class **NTIME(t(n))**: the collection of all languages that are decidable by an $O(t(n))$ nondeterministic Turing machine.

The class of NP: languages that are decidable in polynomial time on a nondeterministic Turing machine, or equivalently, languages that have polynomial time verifiers.

$$NP = \bigcup_k \text{NTIME}(n^k)$$

Example of a language in NP:

**CLIQUE** = $\{<G, k>|\; G \text{ is an undirected graph with k-clique}\}$

The corresponding NTM = On input $<G, k>$ where $G$ is a graph,
1. Nondeterministically select $k$ nodes of $G$.
2. Test whether every pair of nodes has an edge connecting them in $G$.
3. If yes, accept; else, reject.

## Relationship between P and NP

Clearly, any languages in P is also in NP, since NTM can linearly simulate TM.

$$P \subseteq NP$$

But till now, we don't know if they are equal yet. We cannot say $P \neq NP$ just because we cannot think of a polynomial algorithm to solve certain NP problems. It is possible that for every language in NP, there always exists a polynomial TM that decides it, but we are not smart enough yet to discover those polynomial algorithms for certain hard problems.

$$P = NP \; ?$$

Most people believe $P \neq NP$; however, no solution has been found to prove it. But anyway, let me show the summary from the textbook:
* P = the class of languages for which membership can be decided quickly.
* NP = the class of languages for which membership can be verified quickly.

## NP-Completeness

Let's look at some definitions.

**Polynomial time reduction**: this is the same mapping reducibility mentioned in the previous post. The only difference is that here it requires the computable function to be polynomial time. If language $A$ is polynomial time reducible to language $B$, we denote $A \leq_p B$.

Properties:
* It has all the properties of mapping reducibility.
* If $A \leq_p B$ and $B \in P$, then $A \in P$.

**NP-hard**: a language $B$ is NP-hard if every language $A \in NP$ is polynomial time reducible to $B$.

**NP-complete**: a language B is NP-complete if it satisfies the following two conditions:
1. $B \in NP$
2. $B$ is NP-hard (any NP language can be reduced to $B$).

**Theorem**: If any NP-complete language is in P, then P = NP.

Proof: polynomial reduction + polynomial TM = polynomial

**Theorem**: if $B$ is NP-complete and $B \leq_p C$ for $C$ in NP, then $C$ is NP-complete.

Proof: use the property that mapping reduction is transitive.

This theorem provides a way to get more NP-complete languages by using reduction. Just like we use reduction to get more undecidable languages in the previous post, we can get more NP-complete languages if we have a "base" language in NP-complete. In the next post, we will examine an important language - **SAT**, which is proven to be in NP-complete. And we will see more NP-complete languages by reduction from SAT.
