This article is part of my review of Algorithms course. It introduces the concept of **Tree Decomposition**, and a dynamic programming algorithm that solves Maximum Independent Set (**MIS**) problem by using tree decomposition.

## Tree Decomposition

What is tree decomposition? Simply said, we map a graph $G = (V, E)$ to a tree $T$ that follows certain properties, and we can use this tree $T$ to solve some hard problems on the graph. Each node of the decomposed tree $T$ is just a set of vertices in $G$. Formally, the decomposed tree $T$ has the following properties:

1. The union of all sets/nodes $X_i$ equals V. It means every vertex in graph $G$ is at least inside one tree node.
2. For every edge $(u, v)$ in the graph $G$, there exists at least one tree node that contains both $u$ and $v$.
3. If node $X_i$ and $X_j$ both contain a vertex $v$, then all nodes $X_k$ along the (unique) path between $X_i$ and $X_j$ contain $v$ as well.

From the above definition, we can have two important observations:
1. From property 2, every edge has its two vertices both inside some tree nodes, but any two vertices $u$, $v$ in a tree node doesn't necessarily mean there is an edge $(u, v)$.
2. From property 3, for any tree node $X$, and its subtree $T_i$ rooted in child $X_i$, $V'_i = \{v \in T_i - X\}$ is independent with each other (no common vertices between $V'_i$)! Because if two child nodes $X_1$, $X_2$ have common vertex $v$, then $v$ must be in $X$ as well (ancestor $X$ is along the unique path between $X_1$ and $X_2$). Therefore, if we exclude vertices in $X$ from its subtree $T_i$, the remaining vertices $V'_i$ must be independent. $X$ acts like a separator.

**Treewidth**: the width of a tree decomposition is the size of its largest set/node minus one. e.g. if the largest node of $T$ has 3 vertices, then the treewidth of $T$ is $3-1=2$.

## Maximum Independent Set (MIS)

One of the application of tree decomposition is computing [MIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_set_(graph_theory)) problem. Recall the MIS problem is: finding the maximum set of vertices in a graph such that each vertex is not connected with others.

MIS problem itself is NP hard, but if given a tree decomposition with certain width $k$, we can compute the MIS in linear time! The bad news is, getting the tree decomposition with a constant width bound is also NP hard for any graph; but the good news is that, for certain types of graph, it is easy to get their tree decomposition with a constant treewidth. For example, we can easily get a tree decomposition with treewidth 2 for any [outerplanar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outerplanar_graph) graph. The above picture illustrates this: we can always form triangles in an outerplanar graph, and each triangle corresponds to a node in the tree decomposition.

## Dynamic Programming for MIS

The following [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_decomposition#Dynamic_programming) calculates the MIS problem in linear time, given a tree decomposition with treewidth $k$. The algorithm uses dynamic programming.

Let $A(S, i)$ denote the size of the largest independent subset $I$ of $D_{i}$ such that $I \cap X_{i} = S$.
Let $B(S, i, j)$ denote the size of the largest independent subset $I$ of $D_{i}$ such that $I \cap X_{i} \cap X_{j} = S$, where $X_{i}$ and $X_{j}$ are adjacent pair of nodes and $X_{i}$ is farther from the root than $X_{j}$.

$$A(S, i) = |S|+ \sum\limits_{j}(B(S \cap X_{j}, j ,i) - w(S \cap X_{j})) \\
B(S, i, j) = max\:A(S', i)\quad where\:S' \subset X_{i}\:and\:S = S' \cap X_{j}$$

##### Explanation

I know this is hard to read; I also struggled to understand it at first. The hardest part of this algorithm is just to understand the notation. I will try to explain it in a more straightforward manner (hopefully):

* $A(S, i)$ means, given the S (intersection of $I$ and $X_i$), the MIS of the tree that roots in $X_i$. The MIS comes from two parts: the size of $S$ itself, and the size of MIS from each subtree $T_j$.
* We can sum the size of MIS from each subtree $T_j$ independently, because the vertice of each $T_j - X_i$ are independent with each other (see above observation 2)! Therefore, the MIS of each $T_j - X_i$ cannot coincide, and we can just sum them together. What about the MIS from the intersection part $T_j \cap X_i$? It is just a fixed set for each subtree: $S \cap X_j$.
* How do we find the MIS of each subtree? We can try to apply $A()$ again to each child node $X_j$. But the problem is, we don't fully know $S_j=I \cap S_j$ yet; we only know part of $S_j$, which is $S \cap X_j$, the MIS from the intersection part between $X_j$ and its parent $X_i$. To get the MIS of each subtree, the usage of $B(S \cap X_j, j, i)$ kicks in: it applies $A(S_j, j)$ on child node $X_j$ by enumerating each possible $S_j$, under the condition that $S_j\supseteq (S \cap X_j)$.

##### Complexity analysis

Because the given tree decomposition $T$ has width $k$, it means the max node size is $k+1$. Let $T$ has $N$ nodes. There are $O(N2^k)$ substates. If we consider $k$ as a constant, then this dynamic programming algorithm takes linear time.
