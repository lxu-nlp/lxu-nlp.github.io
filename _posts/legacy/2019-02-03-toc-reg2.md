This article is part of my review notes of "Theory of Computation" course. It introduces the **Regular Expression** as another way to represent Regular Language.

Definitions and examples are from the textbook "Introduction to the Theory of Computation" by Michael Sipser.

## Regular Expression

You would be pretty familiar with the regular expression if you have used regex expression in programming languages. Here regular expression is introduced as another way to represent a certain language, and later we will see it is equivalent of regular language, which means both can be represented by finite automaton.

Let's take a look at the definition.

## Equivalence with Finite Automata

**Theorem**: a language is regular **iff** some regular expression describes it.

### Part 1: regular expression $\to$ regular language:

We are proving whatever $L(R)$ generated by the regular expression $R$, $L(R)$ is regular language. What are the ways we know to prove regular language? First, the most basic way is to construct DFA or NFA that recognizes the languages. Also, we can use the closure property of regular operations (see last post).

With the above idea in mind, we can quickly construct simple DFA/NFA to recognize the language generated by the first three cases of regular expression.

Then, we can just use simple induction with regular operations to deal with the rest of the cases.

### Part 2: regular language $\to$ regular expression

Since we get regular language, we get its DFA. The idea is to convert the DFA to another finite automaton called Generalized Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (GNFA), which expresses the same language as NFA but is more concise.; then we will be able to convert GNFA to regular expression easily.

GNFA are simply NFA wherein the transition arrows may have any regular expressions as labels. To convert it to regular expression, we just eliminate its state one by one and accumulate the expression. I will skip the formal definition and details on the book. Here is the example.

### Summary

From the last post and this post, we see that there are three equivalent ways to represent regular languages: NFA, DFA, regular expression. Their conversion has different complexity ($k$ being the number of states in the automaton).
* DFA -> NFA, Regex -> NFA: easy, linear
* NFA -> DFA: $2^k$
* NFA -> regex: $O(4^k)$

Regular language is closed under the following operations:
* Complementation
* Union
* Intersection
* Concatenation
* Star
