Just last week, my dad told me that the ISP installed an optical fiber cable and a small converter in his apartment, so he could now connect to the Internet by using the signals directly from the optical fiber cable in his living room! Wow! That is cool.

But I am more surprised about the fact that the ISP is installing optical fiber cables in residential apartments. This is usually called **FTTH** (fiber-to-the-home), as a solution of “last mile” Internet delivery. Meanwhile, optical fibers traditionally are most widely used as backbone for long-distance transmission with super-high bandwidth. I don’t think it is an easy decision for ISP, as building optical fiber network in residential areas could cost a lot, even possibly surpass the return from sales. Verizon in US is one of the first carries that provided FTTH (its FTTH service called FiOS), and it financed more than $23 billion to build FiOS. And to penetrate markets and win customers, ISP cannot just shift away the building cost by increasing service prices, as customers could always choose competitors’ non-fiber solution. FTTH service can be a real burden for ISP to a certain degree.

But for end users, things become easier. We can still use the traditional Internet service delivery, or we now have the new option of trying FTTH – connecting to Internet by using optical fiber cables at home. The question is, how does FTTH work, what are the advantages of FTTH, and is it necessarily better than traditional ways? After learning some related materials, I did the review here to briefly answer these questions.

### Last Mile Delivery

“Last Mile” refers to the final portion of the telecom networks that deliver services to end-users. It is usually the part between the carrier’s local central office and the actual customer’s building or room. One big problem of the last mile delivery is that:

“The last mile is typically the speed bottleneck in communication networks; its bandwidth effectively limits the bandwidth of data that can be delivered to the customer.” “For example, telephone trunk lines that carry phone calls between switching centers are made of modern optical fiber, but the last mile is typically twisted pair wires.” (from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile>)

Efforts have been made to enhance the service delivery of the last mile. In this article, we are really referring to the delivery of Internet to end-users (non-business customers). Here we only introduce some major solutions for residential areas. However, either solution is based on the legacy telephone or TV copper cables, because those copper wires are already available in almost every building, as long as the building has telephone or TV access.

**EoC** (Ethernet over Copper): runs over copper cables and providing Ethernet access. However, it may not be available if the building is too far from the central office.

**DSL** (Digital Subscriber Line): still, runs over telephone copper cables. DSL exists in some old buildings which don’t have Ethernet access. Usually under 10 Mbps. DSL modem is needed in users’ houses.

**T1**: uses same lines as DSL but different technology: reliable dedicated bandwidth without sharing with others. Expensive and not usually seen in residential apartments (unless you are running small business in your house).

**Coaxial Cable**: runs over coaxial TV cables provided by local cable TV companies like Comcast. Speed can reach more than 100 Mbps. Cable modem is needed in users’ houses.

### FTTH

##### What is FTTH as a solution for last mile delivery?

FTTH requires installation of optical fiber cables to end user’s house. Different from the previous traditional ways that make use of telephone or TV copper cables, FTTH essentially builds whole new optical fiber networks in residential areas and uses them as the transmission media of the last mile. ISP can now deliver Internet service (typically Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet) over optical fibers all the way to end user’s house, without the need of legacy copper lines. The user just needs a small equipment at home that converts light signals to WiFi or Ethernet cable interface.

##### What are the advantages of FTTH against traditional delivering ways?

The advantages of FTTH lie in the properties of optical fiber:

1. The main constraint of traditional copper wires is that, the signals get corrupted very soon during transmission. Copper wires cannot achieve high speed because of distance. If your house is near enough from the carrier’s central office, let’s say 300 meters, you can probably get 500 Mbps Internet over coaxial TV cables. But once you are more than several kilometers away, you wouldn’t expect anything higher than 100 Mbps. However, optical fiber does a great job over long distance transmission. Whether you are 100 meters or 3 kilometers away from the central office, optical fibers can deliver Internet with speed of 500 Mbps or even 1000 Mbps easily.

2. From the operation standpoint, upgrading speed of FTTH service is no more than some simple configurations on the computer, since using optical fiber makes it easy to scale. No more extra equipments are needed. With the converter at home, user can choose freely from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps to 500 Mbps or even more.

##### What is the performance of FTTH?

Because of the properties of optical fibers, FTTH can achieve really high speed in residential areas. Theoretically, by using optical fiber cables for last mile transmission and Gigabit Ethernet cables in end user’s house, FTTH can deliver Internet service with more than 1 Gbps to end user’s devices at home. For example, Google Fiber provides 1 Gbps Internet access, and Verizon FiOS can provide 500 Mbps Internet access.

Here let’s take a look at different types of optical fibers.

**Single-Mode** Optical Fiber Cable: has optical fibers with small diametral core, causing less light reflections, hence better signals over long distance. All Internet backbones use single-mode fibers. Combined with DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing), single-mode fibers can even deliver more than 1 Tbps data rate.

**Multi-Mode** Optical Fiber Cable: has optical fibers with large diametral core, causing more light reflections, hence worse signals than the single-mode fiber. But it is cheaper than the single-mode fiber.

Here is a very good article introducing the different types of optical fibers:

<https://www.multicominc.com/training/technical-resources/single-mode-vs-multi-mode-fiber-optic-cable/>

FTTH uses single-mode fibers to end user’s house, as single-mode fibers perform much better than multi-mode fibers over a distance of several kilometers or more.

Once the Internet with speed of 1 Gbps is delivered to the user’s house via optical fiber cables, the user can then connect all his devices to the Internet via Wifi or Ethernet cables, and enjoy the high speed. Let’s take Ethernet cables as example: Gigabit Ethernet cables can transmit 1 Gbps data rate, not bad even compared to optical fiber. But the maximum distance is only 100 meters. Though, 100 meters are enough to use at home, making Gigabit Ethernet a perfect LAN interface for use at home. Let’s take a look at different types of Ethernet cables.

**Fast Ethernet**: “a collective term for a number of Ethernet standards that carry traffic at the nominal rate of 100 Mbit/s (the original Ethernet speed was 10 Mbit/s).” (from Wiki) It is backward compatible with earlier Ethernet standards, meaning Fast Ethernet supports both 10 Mbps/100 Mbps. It falls in the Ethernet Cable Categories 5/5e. Cat5 cables were the first Fast Ethernet-capable cables to be introduced, but Cat5 has been superseded by the newer Cat 5e cables.

**Gigabit Ethernet**: “is a term describing various technologies for transmitting Ethernet frames at a rate of a gigabit per second (1 Gbit/s), as defined by the IEEE 802.3-2008 standard. It came into use beginning in 1999.” (from Wiki) It is fully backward compatible with earlier Ethernet standards including Fast Ethernet, meaning Gigabit Ethernet supports 10 Mbps/100 Mbps/1000 Mbps. It falls in the Ethernet Cable Categories 5e/6. “While both Cat5 and Cat5e cables contain four twisted pairs of wires, Cat5 only utilizes two of these pairs for Fast Ethernet, while Cat5e uses all four, enabling Gigabit Ethernet speeds.” Though Cat6 cables have higher bandwidth than Cat5e, Cat5e cables are adequate and the most popular for Gigabit Ethernet, for most applications.

Here is a good article that introduces the different types of Ethernet cables:

Most new laptops should come with Gigabit Ethernet network adapter.

## Conclusion
Combining FTTH (using optical fibers for the last mile transmission), and Gigabit Ethernet as LAN interface at home, 1 Gbps Internet service is finally available to end users in residential areas. For end users, it could only be better to have FTTH service, as we don’t lose anything but get a new option. However, if the user only subscribe 100 Mbps Internet by using FTTH, he would not feel any differences from using traditional Internet delivery over copper lines.

There are more last mile delivery options other than FTTH, such as FTTC (Fibre to the Cabinet) which is also popular and powerful. No matter which ways, I guess at least we all agree that the fiber optics is the future.
