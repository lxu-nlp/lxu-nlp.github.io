**Embedding-based Product Retrieval in Taobao Search**. Li et al. KDD'21\
Two-tower: query $\cdot$ item.\
(1) Item: averaged title token hidden (found more effective because of title characteristics)\
(2) (Contextualized) Query: self-attention on (query semantic (multi-granularity query hidden), user history behaviors (past item sequence representation))\
Training: use softmax CE (more global) instead of local pairwise ranking loss.\
Construct harder negative instances by interpolating gold and negative instances (similar to mixed-up).\
