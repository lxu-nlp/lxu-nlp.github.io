LLM reasoning: (1) pretraining on code, as an explicit **logical form expression** and problem solving; (2) adding CoT in instruction tuning can further boost reasoning (for complex tasks, CoT is closer to corpus distribution in pretraining, rather than an abrupt answer)
* How procedure-oriented programming is similar to solving tasks step by step, and how object-oriented programming is similar to decomposing complex tasks into simpler ones.
* Long-term dependency might also be a nice side effect of training on code. As is pointed out by Peter Liu. â€œNext token prediction for language is usually very local.

LLM alignment towards desired behaviors:
1. Instruction-tuning (by task templates): enable zero-shot task understanding
2. Instruction-tuning (by GPT generation): much more diverse tasks than templates
3. RLHF: enable non-unique comparisons (negative sampling), rather than learning a fixed positive responses
   * Good to explore more space with regularization by rewarding; some generative tasks (e.g. summ, dialogue) have diverse responses by nature

LLM challenges:
* Model editing; continuous knowledge updating
* Incorporate external knowledge base
* Structural reasoning & planning

LLM interpretability: text => logical form expression (similar to code) => conclusions?

(2) RL: use another independent LM to provide the score for two response comparison based on given principles. Score: get the log-likelihood of response ID.\
<http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073>

## LLM: Light Finetuning Techniques

Prefix tuning; Adapter; LoRA; ...

**Prefix-Tuning: Optimizing Continuous Prompts for Generation**. Li and Liang. ACL'21\

**The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning**. Lester et al. EMNLP'21\
Prompt-tuning: similar to prefix-tuning, only optimizing a continuous prompt prefix.\
(1) Prompt length can be critical.\
(2) Initializing prompt by class-label vocab performs the best.\
(3) Prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale (same performance as finetuning).\
<https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.243>

**LORA: LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS**. Hu et al. ICLR'22\

<http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685>

## Long Context: Position

**RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding**. Su et al. 2021\
RoPE formulation: as a kernel, when q/k can be encoded by each position separately, and their multiplication represents the relative difference.\ 
Regard hidden as d/2 partitions where each partition is 2-dim, then rotate each partition by \theta based on position.\
Essential kernel: Re(p1 - p2) = f(q, p1) * f(q, p2)\
<http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864>

**EXTENDING CONTEXT WINDOW OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS VIA POSITION INTERPOLATION**. Chen et al. 2023\
Position Interpolation (PI): linearly reduce rotation angle in RoPE (does not have to be integer) proportional to length; with bound proof.\
Observation: RoPE attention score delays as length increases, could exploding when relative position > max length.\
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601>

**Effective Long-Context Scaling of Foundation Models**. Xiong et al. 2023\
(1) continuous pretraining with longer max len limit; reduce rotation angle similar to PI, but fixed.\
(2) SFT with constructed long context examples: build completion from LLM based on short chunk, but use full context for SFT.\
For long example SFT, also enable loss on the long context itself, not only completion.\
<http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16039>

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071>

Same local window size for each attention head. But, half heads on original local regions, while the other half on shifted local regions with overlapping, to enable communication between locals.\
Thus, although receiving local k/v at each attention layer, global attention can still be achieved by stacked attention layers.\

(2) Search a fixed suffix of the user prompt, such that the loss (negative log likelihood) of the affirmative response is low\
(3) How to search: greedy search; selecting top tokens that achieve largest negative gradient at each suffix position INDEPENDENTLY (as if Gibbs sampling); then sample from these candidate tokens and select the sequence with lowest target loss (as if Monte-Carlo).\
(4) Repeat this search process on multiple prompts incrementally, to find the final universal suffix that works for all prompts\
