w/o human annotations:
1) Latent variables: supervised EM; self-supervised reconstruction
2) LLM direct revision; LLM verification (e.g. auto-alignment without human annotations)

structure:
1) graph optimization; higher order (e.g. semantic parsing, entailment graph)
2) open-world discourse
3) hierarchical text

Relation to identify relevance, for search etc.:
* Unary: as attribute, or augmented representation
* Binary: similarity as plain relation but it lacks multi-hop; ideally open-world relation
