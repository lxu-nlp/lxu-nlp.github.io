## Task Modeling

Separate task decomposer

Reasoning graph

## Method Tools

Interesting structured parsing paradigms:
* Constituency parsing
* Sequence generation
* Partial order theory

Latent intermediate steps:
* Supervised EM
* Distill from sampling by stronger model; upper bound: stronger model
* RL, regularized by sampling from capable model; upper bound: better due to exploration?
* If without end task: self-supervised reconstruction
*
